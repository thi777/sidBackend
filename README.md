<hr>

 #### PostgreSQL and MongoDB

 database chosen for use in this project with <br />
 separate containers created in docker

 #### Folder structure end environment setting

 eslint was configured following the airbnb standard

 - eslint
 - prettier

 #### Sequelize e sequelize-cli configuration

 - sequelize is a database orm, that's where I communicate with the database by writing <br />
 in javascript and sequelize is responsible for translating this language to sql
 - sequelize-cli is a command interface that helps you create migrations

 #### Product table creation in database

 I created a table of the description and price of products <br />
 that will use json to integrate with the frontend.

 #### MVC

 Model and controller creation for products

 #### Uploads image

 I decided to create a table just to save the ID of the images that will be stored on the server.
 This will use multer to work with multipart/form-data and create a tmp to store as images.
